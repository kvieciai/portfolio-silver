Lietuvos Paštas, the country’s leading logistics and mail company, has become the heartbeat for many of the cities and communities during the pandemic. Providing an alternative option, helped many people to avoid busy supermarkets and convenience stores.

Back in 2019, the organisation was stepping up the digital transformation of their logistics businesses by focusing on the parcel and mailing services. This involved **reimagining the self-service parcel terminals** — the bread and butter of customer-facing services.

I joined the project as the UI Designer, and helped to build the user interface of their self-service parcel terminals. From **colors, typography, and distinct illustration style** to defining clear guidelines for the visual language — ensuring they could ensure the clarity and consistency of the experience moving forward.

The improved experience helped Lietuvos Paštas to ensure smoother operation of terminals, and provided a more intuitive way to interact with the terminals. Since its launch, the **company has been on the trajectory of growth** — with 280 parcel terminals spanning through 87 cities and towns, nationally.
