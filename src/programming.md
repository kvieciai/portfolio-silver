Sandvik is a global engineering company at the start of its digital transformation. Driven by the mission to improve industrial machining workflows — the company developed a **touch-based, CNC machine programming solution**.

Following a soft-launch, the solution received a positive response from the industry’s early adopters. However, further market research revealed a large group of experts who didn’t have access to touch-based devices — they were first, and foremost desktop users.

This presented an opportunity for Sandvik to improve the adoption rate by **making the solution available on multiple devices and platforms**, including the humble desktop. Our challenge was to make that happen.

We began the project with discovery work. First, we talked to machining experts — this helped to build empathy for the users: their goals, needs and ways of working. Then we defined the problem and requirements — in effect, this helped us to frame what we’ve learned and synthesize it for the rest of the team.

Next up, we started **collaboration sessions**. This involved sketching together, mapping user flows, sharing and building on the ideas of others. This had a major effect on the diversity of ideas and helped us to find great solutions more quickly and effectively.

Following ideation, we **built functional prototypes** to evaluate solutions with users. This gave us a sense of what users expected from desktop-based programming experience, and allowed us to adjust our efforts accordingly.

On the the right side, there's a 3D representation of the CAD model, where you can see how your adjustments will impact the model." %}

After converging on the interaction model, we shifted our focus to visual interface design. This is where I had an opportunity to rethink how we approached **visual language, components and patterns** to ensure the solution could conditionally adapt based on the device's screen dimensions.

I'm particularly proud of what we've accomplished as a (relatively) small team at Sandvik: from navigating challenges, diverse (sometimes conflicting) perspectives, and technical constraints to delivering a solution that **enabled access to one of the most intuitive CNC machine programming experiences**.
